About Dataset
Context
Use this heart disease classification dataset to predict which patients are most likely to suffer from a heart disease in the near future using the features given.

Content
Data Dictionary

age: Displays the age of the individual.

sex: Displays the gender of the individual using the following format: 1 = male, 0 = female

cp- Chest-pain type: displays the type of chest-pain experienced by the individual using the following format : 0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non—anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic

trestbps- Resting Blood Pressure: displays the resting blood pressure value of an individual in mmHg (unit). anything above 130-140 is typically cause for concern.

chol- Serum Cholesterol: displays the serum cholesterol in mg/dl (unit)

fbs- Fasting Blood Sugar: compares the fasting blood sugar value of an individual with 120mg/dl. If fasting blood sugar > 120mg/dl, then: 1 (true) else : 0 (false) '>126' mg/dL signals diabetes

restecg- Resting ECG : displays resting electrocardiographic results 0 = normal 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality 2 = left ventricular hyperthrophy

thalach- Max heart rate achieved: displays the max heart rate achieved by an individual.

exang- Exercise induced angina: 1 = yes ,0 = no

oldpeak- ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest: displays the value, which is an integer or float.

slope- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment : 0 = upsloping: better heart rate with exercise (uncommon), 1 = flat: minimal change (typical healthy heart), 2 = downsloping: signs of unhealthy heart

ca- Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluorescence: displays the value as an integer or float.

thal: Displays the thalassemia : 1,3 = normal 6 = fixed defect 7 = reversible defect: no proper blood movement when excercising

target: Displays whether the individual is suffering from heart disease or not: 1 = yes, 0 = no
